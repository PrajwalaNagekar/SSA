Reading and sharing stories can help children develop literacy skills, spark imagination, stimulate curiosity and develop communication skills. Children who read develop broad vocabulary, increased general knowledge and a better understanding of other cultures. At Sri Sri Academy, the best day boarding school in West Bengal, we encourage students to read whether itâ€™s for information or for fun.
