The comfort, safety, health, hygiene, and emotional well-being of the students are taken care of by well-trained wardens and staff. The male and female wardens of the respective hostels are strict yet compassionate . They help the students, take care of their needs as well as maintain discipline. They inspect the dormitories, study units and common-rooms, to ensure that the children maintain neatness and personal hygiene. They also keep in touch with parents via email or telephonically, providing regular updates about their childrenâ€™s welfare.</p>   
         <p className="text-gray-900 text-base md:text-[17px]  leading-relaxed mb-3">
Along with the wardens there are residential teachers who give personalized attention to each student. They work closely with the children , supervise study hours and provide extra support for academic excellence. The school also has proper mentoring and counselling sessions for the students.
